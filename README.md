# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Deployment

This application is configured for deployment using [Firebase App Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/app-hosting).

To deploy your application, you will need the Firebase CLI.

1.  **Install the Firebase CLI** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    ```

2.  **Login to Firebase**:
    ```bash
    firebase login
    ```

3.  **Deploy your application**:
    From the root of your project directory, run the following command:
    ```bash
    firebase deploy
    ```

The CLI will build your Next.js application and deploy it to Firebase App Hosting. Once complete, it will provide you with the URL to your live application.
